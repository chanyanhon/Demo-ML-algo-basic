repository to showcase my work to highlight my skills


# Folder:
## 1. EDA_titanic
Using Titanic dataset, to demostrate the exploratory data analysis by visualization & aggregation, feature engineering (e.g. one-hot encoding) & descriptive statistics


## 2. Regression_boston_housing
Using Boston-Housing dataset, to demostrate feature engineering for regression analysis and modelling, e.g. normalization (e.g. box-cox transformation) & noramlity test (D'Agostino K^2 Test), polynormial features creating, grid-search for hyperparameter tuning, regularization & model comparison


## 3. Classification_telco_customer_churn
Using Telco_customer_churn dataset, to demostrate feature engineering & selection for classification analysis and modelling, e.g. One-hot encoding, correlation analysis for feature selection, scaling, upsampling (SMOTE), model comparison, features importance & interpretation.
