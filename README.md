# portfolio_repository
This is the repository to showcase my work & highlight my basic skills with popular ML-algo. You can directly read the Jupyter notebook here for the analysis steps.

# Folder:
## 1. EDA_titanic
Using Titanic dataset, to demostrate the exploratory data analysis by visualization & aggregation, feature engineering (e.g. one-hot encoding) & descriptive statistics


## 2. Regression_boston_housing
Using Boston-Housing dataset, to demostrate feature engineering for regression analysis and modelling, e.g. normalization (e.g. box-cox transformation) & noramlity test (D'Agostino K^2 Test), polynormial features creating, grid-search for hyperparameter tuning, regularization & model comparison


## 3. Classification_telco_customer_churn
Using Telco_customer_churn dataset, to demostrate feature engineering & selection for classification analysis and modelling, e.g. One-hot encoding, correlation analysis for feature selection, scaling, upsampling (SMOTE), model comparison, features importance & interpretation.


## 4. DeepLearning_telco_customer_churn
Using Telco_customer_churn dataset, on top of __Classification_telco_customer_churn__ project, to demostrate other classification modelling by random-forest and neural network models with tuning, e.g. epochs, no. of layer, activation, by evaluation metrics such as AUC. & finally interpret room for improvement by comparing to baseline model.


## 5. Algo_trading
Simple Algo-trading script with implementing multiple rule-based strategy (MACD, RSI, BOLL) with backtesting. 

## 6. Time_series_analysis_ARIMA_gold_price_10years
Using gold price from 2000 to 2011, to demostrate pre-processing & time series modelling by ARIMA models, e.g. feature engineering (e.g. rolling mean,std), seasonal decomposition, stationarity testing and correcting (differencing, tuning by US cpi figures) with seasonal effects.
